Volumetric 3D printing enables the rapid fabrication of centimetre- scale objects, with the fastest techniques requiring only a few seconds. Having emerged during the past 7 years, this new family 

of technologies is posed to revolutionize additive manufacturing, fabricating objects and functional parts in a layerless fashion directly within a vat of material in response to optical and acoustic fields. Modern volumetric 3D printing methods are overcoming many challenges inherent to conventional layer-by-layer approaches, the standard in research and industry for the past 40 years. This Review focuses on identifying upcoming challenges and research directions in materials chemistry and process engineering to move volumetric 3D printing from its infancy to its broader adoption. Recent advances include the development of techniques based on optical tomography, light and acoustic holography, xolography, multiwavelength and upconversion-mediated printing, as well as the introduction of materials with custom-designed properties. Promising applications in the development of optical and photonic components, rapid prototyping, soft robotics and bioprinting of living cells are discussed along with a vision for the evolution of volumetric manufacturing towards a broadly accessible technology platform.

Although tomographic printing is currently the fastest additive manu - facturing technology available, its broader application and industrial adoption are strongly dependent on further developments in recon-

struction algorithms to enhance contrast between the intended print and off-target regions of the resin, on the mitigation of light scattering in composite resins and on overcoming light attenuation challenges to fabricate large parts.

**Lightsheet-based printing**

Although tomographic printing operates in a radial geometry, other approaches use light sheets to print thin layers within the resin volume in planar-faced vessels. Dual-colour photopolymerization printing, such as xolography, utilizes two optical paths: an ultraviolet (UV) light sheet sweeps across the volume to temporarily activate a photoswitch - able photoinitiator, and, concurrently, an orthogonal patterned vis - ible light projection locally induces polymerization and crosslinking at the overlap of the two beams17–19 [(F](#_page13_x305.00_y253.87)[ig](#_page13_x305.00_y277.87). 1c). [As](#_page2_x391.00_y110.87) the light sheet scans across the volume, the projection is continuously updated to the cor- responding cross-section of the target geometry. A major advantage of this approach is the use of fast thermal reversible photoswitchable initiators, which prevents out-of-plane crosslinking after the initiator undergoes thermal relaxation into its unreactive state. This confine - ment of the polymerization reaction allows for a higher dosage contrast compared with tomographic approaches. Xolography thus enables the production of centimetre-scale objects in minutes, with feature sizes down to a few micrometres.![ref2]

An approach similar to xolography, lightsheet 3D microprinting20, works on the microscale and utilizes two-step photoinitiators. The use of microscope objectives for both the lightsheet generation and the perpendicular projection paths yields higher resolution features (~1 µm) at the expense of printable volume, making this method par- ticularly suited for applications requiring intricate fidelity. Efforts to use more general photoinitiators have also led to other techniques that rely on the precise spatial control of light rather than on special- ized photochemistry. High-resolution volumetric printing has been achieved by leveraging the intersection of two orthogonal light sources of the same wavelength to confine the photo-crosslinking reaction21. Here, a 2D galvanometer scans a beam orthogonally along the plane of a lightsheet, with exposure conditions set to ensure dosages remain below the crosslinking threshold in all but in-plane regions. Although this approach attempts to minimize out-of-plane exposure, it does not eliminate it; thus, high-contrast dosage targets become proportionally more difficult with increasing feature height, making this method better suited for thinner planar constructs.Overall, key challenges in printing approaches based on light sheets are improving the printing speed by introducing faster-relaxing initiators and using more common initiators to broaden the user base.

fabrication. Acoustic field-based printing techniques have emerged as a promising avenue. Sound waves have previously been harnessed for the manipulation and spatial patterning of particles, including liv - ing cells. These sound-based assembly approaches leverage acoustic forces to create complex distributions without the need for support materials or direct contact. Acoustic cell patterning typically uti - lizes standing wave fields to generate pressure nodes and antinodes, in which cells or microparticles are trapped and organized into pre - defined arrangements22–25[. ](#_page13_x305.00_y325.87)[Ta](#_page13_x305.00_y381.87)king this concept further, precisely controlled acoustic waves have been harnessed to selectively solidify materials within a volume26,2[7 o](#_page13_x305.00_y405.87)[ff](#_page13_x305.00_y421.87)ering unique advantages in terms of material compatibility and penetration depth.Direct sound printing (DSP) and deep-penetrating acoustic volumetric printing (DAVP) are additive manufacturing processes that utilize focused ultrasound to print within a volume of resin26,27[. ](#_page13_x305.00_y405.87)[Fo](#_page13_x305.00_y421.87)cused ultrasound can generate localized cavitation or high-temperature regions within sound-active inks containing a sonoresponsive initiator, initiating a sonochemical or sonothermal polymerization reaction. By translating the focal point, a 3D structure is volumetrically printed with sub-millimetre resolu - tion (Fig.[1d).](#_page2_x391.00_y110.87) An evolution of this approach is holographic DSP. Here, a 3D-printed acoustic holographic phase plate is positioned above the ultrasonic transducer. Its purpose is to encode the phase information needed to shape the ultrasound wavefront into an arbitrary focus — in this case, the cross-section of the target geometry28. This[ a](#_page13_x305.00_y437.87)pproach has the advantage of rapidly polymerizing multiple regions simultaneously, thus forming the desired object in a single shot (Fig. [1e](#_page2_x391.00_y110.87)). However, because the 3D-printed phase plate cannot be modulated, the inten - sity pattern at the focal plane remains fixed, and thus more complex 3D structures can only be fabricated through translations of this plane.

**Materials design for volumetric printing**

The growth and impact of volumetric printing are intimately linked to the development of new material formulations and a deeper under - standing of the material properties required for high-resolution, high-efficiency printing. The starting materials for volumetric printing, 

known as resins or bioresins, contain different categories of compo - nents (Fig.3[).](#_page7_x39.00_y414.87) VAM requires different resin compositions from layerwise techniques and opens promising possibilities for integrating innovative materials and new functions. The individual components of the resins 

can be divided into two major categories. The first are the initiators, molecules that convert different stimuli (optical and acoustic) into reac - tive species that induce a spatiotemporally controlled polymerization 

reaction. The second are the various classes of reactive materials that lead to the formation of crosslinked polymer networks in response to 

the printing stimuli through various chemical reactions. Beside these two main classes, other compounds can be used to improve shape 

fidelity and resolution: the additives. They are not directly involved in the material crosslinking process, but fulfil other important func - tions, such as rheological modulation, refractive index matching and 

contrast enhancement27,29–[32](#_page13_x305.00_y421.87)[.](#_page13_x305.00_y453.87)

**Initiators and reactive species**

The pivotal element for all volumetric printing resins is the initiator, which translates the spatiotemporal information of the stimulus into chemical reactivity. Although tomographic printing and dual-colour photopolymerization printing use UV and visible light as stimulus for photochemical triggered polymerization, DAVP uses focused ultra - sound in combination with thermal initiators. Tomographic print - ing uses mostly type I photoinitiators based on phosphine oxide16,

Although for these techniques reporting the printing time may be more accurate, printing speed values facilitate a direct comparison with other techniques, including conventional layerwise printing. cThe printing speed for multibeam superposition, tomographic volumetric printing and holographic direct sound printing was calculated dividing the volume of the printed objects by the production time. dThe speed of the lightsheet printing techniques was calculated by multiplying the translational shift speed in millimetre per second with the lateral area of the build volume in square millimetre, therefore constituting an estimation of the maximum printable section. eThe print speed for deep penetration acoustic volumetric printing is estimated from the voxel generation rate per second, multiplied with the voxel volume in cubic millimetre. fGlassomer GmbH. gSartomer.

Independent of the type of radiation source, the absorption by the initiator leads to an exponential attenuation of excitation irradiance across the resin vat that limits polymer conversion as light penetrates deeper into the vial, as described by the Lambert–Beer law. To limit the resulting inhomogeneous crosslinking, the initiator concentration is kept low in contrast to the typical design requirements for resins opti mized for layer-wise printing (stereolithography). In volumetric print ing, attenuation from high concentrations of photoinitiators would result in low light doses delivered into the middle of the vat, effectively reducing the maximum productive penetration depth and therefore ![ref2]

These mechanisms also allow for further red-shifting of the wavelength, beneficial in the context of printing living matter37.

<a name="_page7_x39.00_y414.87"></a>**Fig. 3 | Key components of the resins for volumetric printing.** Resin components for volumetric 3D printing methods showing exemplary structures for the different material classes and printing techniques. The major components outlined here are initiators, building blocks for the polymerization and crosslinking reactions and additives. Initiators translate stimuli to reactivity taking advantages of different cleavage reactions (shown schematically in the top row), enabling the polymerization of the resin building blocks. Commonly used motifs are unimolecular single-colour phosphine-oxide initiators (type I photoinitiators, which undergo a unimolecular bond cleavage upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, generating free radicals) or bimolecular dicarbonyl-based initiators (type II photoinitiators, which require a co-initiator to generate free radicals) for multibeam and tomographic methods; spiropyran–merocyanine ![](Aspose.Words.fc26da43-9ffb-4213-a023-6baeba7d1748.025.png)

In ad[di](#_page13_x305.00_y637.87) - tion, sono-induced heating of a thermal initiator has been exploited for DAVP[27](#_page13_x305.00_y421.87). The local heat at the focus point of the ultrasound enables polymer crosslinking in seconds. To assist the focusing process, the addition of rheological modifiers and of a phase-transition acoustic absorber is essential to compromise between acoustic streaming — the fluid flow driven by the high-amplitude pressure of focused acoustic waves — and penetration depth27. I[n ](#_page13_x305.00_y421.87)ultrasound-based techniques, acoustic absorption has a critical role in converting mechanical energy into chemical reactivity, which is influenced by the ultrasound profile, including frequency, pulse duration and duty cycle27.

A further challenge in tomographic printing is achieving sufficient printing contrast, that is, translating intensity ratios into feature ![ref2]

couple combined with tertiary amine type II dual-colour initiators for light sheet printing (which undergoes a structural change when exposed to a first, UV excitation wavelength and, in this excited state, reacts in the presence of a secondary, red excitation wavelength, producing free radicals); and thermal initiators for sono printing (which undergo cleavage and generation of radicals in response to redox reactions triggered by thermal stimuli). The main building blocks for the polymer network can be monomers, crosslinkers and (bio) polymers carrying reactive groups, such as unsaturated bonds. Additives include a diverse array of compounds that enhance printing resolution and shape fidelity via, for example, rheology modification, refractive index matching or contrast enhancement.

sharpness. Besides the choice of printing hardware, the reactivity of the initiator and monomer/crosslinker also has a pivotal role. For example, improved contrast in tomographic printing has been achieved by slowing down the crosslinking kinetics through the addi - tion of radical scavengers such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)[43](#_page13_x305.00_y693.87). Conversely, in dual-colour photopolymerization printing, the merocyanine form also absorbs the incident UV light, opening up a competing single-wavelength channel that leads to undesired UV-mediated crosslinking. By separating the absorption of the dor - mant and active forms, the spectral and thus spatial addressability of the initiator molecules inside the volume and therefore the reach- able contrast increase. Although light as stimulus provides exquisite spatial resolution, local heat generation is hard to control owing to dissipation; therefore, a lower contrast and resolution is associated with DAVP. For all techniques, the diffusion of reactive species lowers the achievable printing contrast and can reduce printing resolution, even after the stimulus is removed, for example, during dark curing.

The production of optical elements is another area that would gain from layerless additive manufacturing. Because of their complex shapes, manufacturing high-quality lenses often involves manual labour. Additive manufacturing offers more controllable design freedom, as well as automation that can make the large-scale fab - rication process more efficient. However, surface smoothness is a major requisite for refractive optics, with typical tolerances below *λ*/4 for precision optics and *λ*/20 for high-precision optics (~100 nm and ~20 nm, respectively). As sequential additive manufacturing methods suffer from layering, they cannot achieve the required

**Soft robotics and movable parts**

Given the freedom of design and the use of various soft, deformable materials, the use of volumetric printing approaches for soft robot - ics and free-moving structures is being explored81,82 (Fi[g.](#_page14_x39.00_y709.87)[ 4](#_page14_x39.00_y725.87)b). W[ith ](#_page8_x39.00_y705.87)

that enabled unidirectional flow control through the smooth movement of a free-floating sphere within an outer hydrogel cage structure10. These soft resins were similarly used to create a replica of a venous valve at a high enough resolution to enable the leaflets to open and close in response to flow, as observed in native structures83.

Although](#_page14_x305.00_y133.87) simply tailoring the physical and mechanical properties of these bioresins can yield various soft robotic elements and actuators, using metamaterial design principles enables the fabrication of complex architectures with controllable degrees of deformation and mechanical properties, such as auxetic meshes85[. ](#_page14_x305.00_y149.87)Furthermore, the compatibility of volumetric printing approaches with smart materials — such as piezoelectric86, con[du](#_page14_x305.00_y173.87)ctive87 or thermoresponsive88 s[ys](#_page14_x305.00_y213.87)tems — expands opportunities for 4D print - ing, in which stimuli-responsive materials can further enhance the actuation and tunability of soft robots.

**Volumetric printing of living materials**

With the rapid advancement of volumetric printing strategies, an important application field has been biomedical research, aiming to develop advanced in vitro models and functional implantable living units that mimic the structural complexity of human tissues (Fig.4c). The contactless and high-speed nature of volumetric printing meth - ods makes them ideal candidates for the processing of living cellular structures, reducing the long printing times required by layer-by-layer approaches to create clinically relevant, centimetre-scale structures10,89. In 2019, the compatibility of an ultra-fast printing process, volumet- ric bioprinting, with biocompatible hydrogels and living cells was first demonstrated10.

Ste[mm](#_page13_x305.00_y141.87)ing from this first study, a wide array of works have sought to explore the potential of this bioprinting process.

N[on](#_page13_x305.00_y453.87)etheless, the nature of the tomographic approach poses a limit on printable cell densities, as their heterogeneous optical properties lead to light scattering throughout the depth of the printing vat, which in turn leads to impaired printing quality above a certain cell density (2.5–5 × 106 cells ml−1)29, a l[im](#_page13_x305.00_y453.87)itation

[Ef](#_page13_x305.00_y541.87)forts to enhance the mechanical stability of bioprinted structures have also been undertaken, either through the use of natural biomaterials with unique mechanical properties, such as silk[35 ](#_page13_x305.00_y557.87)or through the incorporation of reinforcing structures into the printing process through the combination of volumetric bioprint - ing with melt electrowritten meshes83. T[he ](#_page14_x305.00_y109.87)desire to further mimic the complex multicellular nature of native tissues has also led to the development of approaches to create multimaterial and multicellular structures through sequential steps of the volumetric bioprinting process83[,85](#_page14_x305.00_y109.87)[ a](#_page14_x305.00_y149.87)nd through the combination of embedded extrusion print - ing with volumetric bioprinting91,94.[ N](#_page14_x305.00_y269.87)[ot](#_page14_x305.00_y333.87)ably, these works also demon - strated that tomographic printing can resolve artefact-free prints in which confined regions in the construct show high cell density, 50 × 106 cells ml−1 (ref.

Although less explored so far, other approaches such as fila - mented light biofabrication and acoustic volumetric patterning and printing have also shown compatibility with living cell encapsula - tion. Filamented light biofabrication, which uses controlled speckled light projections and the same bioresins as volumetric bioprinting, enables the creation of highly aligned microfibre structures that elicit cell alignment and interconnectivity109,110.[ A](#_page14_x305.00_y605.87)[cou](#_page14_x305.00_y621.87)stic patterning enables the precise, contactless positioning and entrapment of liv - ing cells into predetermined architectures111.

These advances, together with the hardware and software develop - ments discussed in the next section for higher-precision bioprinting of multimaterial configurations, promise to create physiologically rel - evant tissue models at scale for biomedical and personalized medicine applications.

**Hardware and computational advancements**

**Advanced hardware design in volumetric printing set-ups** Advancing VAM towards industrial-scale production presents signifi- cant challenges in terms of hardware design and optimization, as sys- tems capable of increased throughput, reduced human intervention and enhanced reliability are needed. In light-based printing, a primary hurdle is overcoming the limitations on printable object size, typically ![ref2]

constrained to a few centimetres owing to exponential light absorption within the resins.

Recent hardware innovations are reimagining the geometries accessible with tomographic VAM beyond traditional cylindrical vials. One configuration delivers projections along a helical path over the length of a tall cylindrical volume112. [In ](#_page14_x305.00_y653.87)such a set-up, the volume rotates while radially offset projections are translated linearly along the axis of rotation, enabling the fabrication of high aspect ratio constructs limited only by the length of the vat. However, light attenuation still has a role in limiting the maximum cross-sectional area of such prints. Pushing scalability further, methods using roll-to-roll approaches have also emerged, both in traditional layer-based 3D printing such as continuous liquid interface production113 and[ in](#_page14_x305.00_y669.87) tomographic VAM114. In roll-to-roll tomographic printing, the photoresin is deposited onto a spool-driven tape, and tomograms that account for the unique planar geometry and continuous substrate motion are calculated. Although currently limited to mechanically compliant materials such as ther - mally gelling photoresists or hydrogels, this approach enables the printing of planar geometries with theoretically unlimited lengths.

The integration of light sheet set-ups with continuous material flow within the vat also presents an avenue for enhancing production throughput and enabling uninterrupted (multimaterial) fabrication processes, as recently demonstrated using xolography18. In co[nt](#_page13_x305.00_y261.87)rast to conventional methods in which the light sheet traverses a static volume of material, this technique uses a precisely controlled laminar flow of photosensitive resin through a stationary light sheet. Through the use of a carefully designed flow cell, it was possible to achieve a relatively uniform velocity distribution in the printing zone while mitigating undesired polymerization at boundaries. This configura - tion enabled simultaneous and continuous production of multiple objects, with volumetric fabrication rates of up to 1.75 mm³ s−1 and feature resolutions approaching 10 µm, rendering it particularly suit- able for applications demanding high-volume production of intricate microstructures. Adapting this continuous flow approach to other lightsheet-based methodologies may offer opportunities for further improving production rates.

**Advanced algorithms and software tools**

For enhancing resolution and accuracy in VAM, reconstruction algo - rithms that precisely modulate the patterning of the physical field of interest (via spatial control of the light dose or acoustic energy deliv - ered) onto the reactive resins are key. Given the interdisciplinarity of the problem, collaborations between materials and computer scientists are needed. This challenge is especially evident in light-based print - ing, whereas for acoustic VAM, most resolution improvements are focused on increasing hologram resolution. Although lightsheet-based technology relies on highly accurate projection algorithms derived by long-standing experience from digital light processing printing, tomo - graphic VAM has seen most endeavours in improving the Radon trans - form, which, owing to its ill-posed nature and reliance on ideal-case assumptions, makes the technique prone to printing artefacts115. An ideal mathematical framework should be physics-aware, incorpo - rating physical parameters of the resin and the optics of the light beam; differentiable, allowing optimization and inclusion in machine-learning pipelines; parallelizable, for faster computation; and chemistry-aware. Various optimization approaches beyond the standard filtered tomo - graphic approach have been used to attain more faithful reconstruc - tion, with techniques such as object-space optimization of tomographic reconstructions116, [gr](#_page14_x305.00_y725.87)adient descent optimization8,117, wav[e](#_page13_x305.00_y109.87)[ op](#_page15_x39.00_y109.87)tical

Recent works have also attempted to model and couple the chemical dynamics of the photopolymerization process to varying degrees of detail, with implications for both tomographic and lightsheet-based volumetric printing approaches44,12[1. ](#_page13_x305.00_y709.87)[Th](#_page15_x39.00_y173.87)ese studies have examined parameters such as radical and oxygen diffusion rates to enhance accuracy and printing homogeneity, demonstrating that even global parameters can signifi - cantly improve print fidelity, albeit at the expense of computational efficiency. Algorithmic approaches to scattering mitigation within resins have also been explored, using a combination of imaging and selective modifications to projections in the Fourier domain101, using[ ](#_page14_x305.00_y477.87)a physically based inverse rendering problem or using a differentiable simulation of light rays within an arbitrary scattering or absorptive volume1[22. ](#_page15_x39.00_y189.87)These developments are particularly important for expand - ing the range of opaque, composite and cell-laden materials compatible with light-based VAM.

**Monitoring and real-time imaging**

A major challenge in 3D printing is that of real-time monitoring and metrology, important for assessing print progression, and potentially enabling dynamic adjustments to optimize print quality. Most often, simple imaging of the volume does not yield a sufficient contrast between the polymerized and unpolymerized regions. The challenge is further compounded when working with resins with low polymer content or containing scattering agents, common in bioprinting appli - cations, in which water-rich hydrogels and the presence of opaque tissue-derived material can significantly reduce the signal-to-noise ratio. To address these issues in low-contrast scenarios, shadowgraph imaging9[ a](#_page13_x305.00_y125.87)nd Schlieren imaging123 h[av](#_page15_x39.00_y205.87)e been used with tomographic VAM. These techniques are capable of visualizing minute changes in the refractive index as a consequence of the polymerization process. Schlieren imaging has also been leveraged in a tomographic imaging modality to generate 3D reconstructions of the printing process and can perform quantitative measurements of the internal refractive index1[23. ](#_page15_x39.00_y205.87)Similarly, optical scattering tomography has been used for 3D visualization, where instead of measuring changes to the refractive index, side-scattered light provided by a top-down illumination set-up is imaged, thus providing the contrast124. T[his](#_page15_x39.00_y237.87) approach is particularly effective when the scattering properties of the resin change in response to photopolymerization. Notably, this method has been integrated into feedback control loops to automatically terminate the printing process upon achieving the necessary light dose, based on feedback from the reconstruction data. Such modalities, although demonstrated in the context of tomographic VAM, are useful for any VAM approaches utilizing transparent resins. Future research is likely to incorporate other modalities such as real-time optical coherence tomography to further enhance sensitivity and robustness to scattering125. Despit[e ](#_page15_x39.00_y253.87)these advancements, the use of imaging for real-time print modification remains both an important objective and a substantial challenge in VAM.

There are several technologies with the potential to advance VAM. For light-projection techniques, key advancements lie with improv - ing the way optical projections are encoded. Currently, tomographic

[The](#_page15_x39.00_y261.87)se improvements simplify optical systems by replacing lenses with phase masks on spa - tial light modulators and can correct aberrations in printing vials or resin through wavefront control128.

The HoloTile technique, for instance, uses a phase-only spatial light modulator partitioned into sub-holograms to generate complex inten - sity distributions in the reconstruction plane. This computer-generated holographic modality offers several advantages for tomographic VAM and light-sheet approaches, including speckle-reduced fabrication, higher photon efficiency, enhanced spatial resolution and improved depthoffocus129[–13](#_page15_x39.00_y317.87)1[. T](#_page15_x39.00_y357.87)he HoloTile approach has also been proposed with amplitude-type spatial light modulators, integrating binary-phase Lee holography using a digital micromirror device132. Th[is a](#_page15_x39.00_y373.87)pproach could be further adapted in techniques such as xolography to improve resolution and penetration depth.

In the field of sound-based printing, there is a growing effort to find new ways of modulating the acoustic wavefront dynamically, to switch from single-voxel crosslinking or passive holographic projections to a regime capable of rapidly fabricating large, arbitrary geometries. Programmable acoustic holography is an active area of research, most commonly using phased arrays. These, however, suffer from resolution, power and frequency limitations. Programmable acoustic metasur - faces1[33 ](#_page15_x39.00_y405.87)are a potential way forward, as they can be actively tuned for real-time phase modulation. The successful implementation of these advanced acoustic technologies in VAM could bridge the gap between theoretical acoustic manipulation and practical manufacturing capa - bilities, opening new avenues for rapid, high-resolution fabrication of complex 3D structures.

A key capability of VAM is overprinting structures non-invasively 

onto pre-existing features within the build volume. Advancing on this potential, generative, adaptive, context-aware 3D printing (GRACE) is a new workflow whereby a combination of volumetric imaging and computer vision detects the contents of the printing environment, and parametric modelling and VAM enable the production of structures precisely generated to align or adapt to geometric, chemical or bio - logical properties of objects loaded into the vat134. Th[e i](#_page15_x39.00_y421.87)ntroduction of such context-driven fabrication can have an important role for the production of highly tailored, multimaterial parts and for printing composite resins (for example, those containing living cells, particles, fibres or other inclusions), with applications in bioengineering, soft robotics and high-performance metamaterials, expanding the ability of additive manufacturing to produce structurally complex objects.

Computer vision and machine-learning tools also have clear poten - tial for early detection of printing errors and on-the-fly quality control and closed-loop correction of printing parameters to improve print- ing quality, as already investigated for other printing technologies135. Dealing with the challenges associated with retrieving, reconstructing and updating large volumetric imaging data sets, as well as generating new optimized projections while keeping pace with the rapid printing process, means that advanced computational frameworks are required. The use of trained artificial intelligence tools, such as neural network models, could potentially accelerate the processing of imaging data, 

the generation of context-driven architectures and the calculation of corrective measures. These models could be trained on extensive data sets of print outcomes, allowing them to, for example, quickly recog - nize deviations and perform corrections and potentially simulate the process for a given material and enact corrective actions on the actual volumetric printing session. Field-programmable gate arrays could also be used to perform specific computational tasks with high effi - ciency, allowing for faster processing of imaging data and calculation of light-dose corrections. As these technologies continue to evolve, the successful integration of real-time imaging and correction mechanisms could enhance the accuracy of VAM systems.

**Multimaterial and multitechnology manufacturing**

Although these envisioned technical advancements are realized, another approach towards increasing the complexity of printed con- structs lies in combining various additive manufacturing technologies to fabricate hybrid prints with advanced functionalities. The concept of multimaterial and multitechnology printing has been largely explored with volumetric tomographic printing. At its most simple, the fabrica - tion of multimaterial constructs has been achieved through the layer - ing of different resins within the printing vial85 or t[hr](#_page14_x305.00_y149.87)ough the use of sequential printing steps45,83,[85](#_page13_x305.00_y725.87)[. T](#_page14_x305.00_y109.87)[o ](#_page14_x305.00_y149.87)achieve smooth multimaterial print - ing, it is crucial to ensure that the resins share similar optical properties (refractive index and transparency) to prevent light scattering, which hampers resolution and print material interface formation. Although this process efficiently combines multiple materials, the creation of highly intertwined, complex structures through this method is limited in terms of efficient optical matching and print alignment. Without in-line imaging processes that can automate print alignment, the field has turned to the combination of alternative approaches to create accurately patterned, multimaterial constructs.

To enhance the multiscale organization of volumetric prints, sev - eral converged approaches have been developed to precisely introduce different materials in the volumetric printing vat. For example, the combination of embedded extrusion printing with volumetric bioprint - ing has been explored recently, by performing the extrusion prints within photosensitive support resins that are then directly exposed to the tomographic projection process to create hybrid structures91,94. Another method to intricately pattern particles or cells within the volumetric printing resin vat, Sonoprint, hybridizes tomographic VAM with 3D acoustic assembly by strategically positioning an array of piezoelectric transducers around the index-matching bath of the print volume. By modulating the amplitude, frequency and position of the transducers, various 3D patterning regimes were accomplished. By combining this method with tomographic VAM, structures with com- plex internal distributions of particles or cells have been fabricated22. A third approach to achieve multiscale complexity stems from the combination of volumetric printing with two-photon ablation. Here, volumetric prints with macroscale channel features of ~400 µm were produced first, and later ‘edited’ through two-photon ablation with microchannels down to 2 µm in diameter, creating a multiscale structure90.[ A](#_page14_x305.00_y253.87)lthough the penetration depth of two-photon abla - tion is not quite compatible with the volumetric sizes of larger prints (<500 µm), using stimuli with deeper penetrability (such as acoustic waves)2[7 c](#_page13_x305.00_y421.87)ould enable the editing of large print volumes.

Another feature of tomographic printing that has been harnessed to create hybrid, multimaterial constructs is the ability to print over pre-formed, opaque materials8. Dr[a](#_page13_x305.00_y109.87)wing from this, the incorporation of polycaprolactone melt electrowritten meshes for the mechanical ![ref2]

reinforcement of GelMA hydrogels was recently used to enhance bio - printed construct stability83. A[lt](#_page14_x305.00_y109.87)hough the incorporation of the high- resolution microfibre structures did not hinder the printing resolution, it did elicit light attenuation at specific rotation angles of the printing vat and may, in the case of thicker and more convoluted structures, pose a limitation for this type of overprinting approach. Optimizing methods to correct for shadowing effects induced by these opaque structures would go a long way in creating more complex multimaterial structures84. As the field of volumetric printing continues to advance, the convergence of different additive manufacturing techniques is sure to bring about enhanced print properties and functionality, so long as the processes and materials used are carefully tailored to ensure their compatibility. In the long run, the development of devices that integrate multiple of these approaches in a single set-up, in combination with the development of generative algorithms that facilitate print alignment and monitoring, can bring about the next generation of hybrid volumetric prints with highly tailorable properties and material compositions.

**New directions in material design**

Looking forward, the continuous advancements in volumetric printing hardware and the development of new algorithms will synergistically need to integrate with new materials (photo)initiator technologies, and emerging applications across VAM methodologies. For the exist - ing approaches using radical-based polymerization, for instance, new photoswitchable photoinitiators17, two[-s](#_page13_x305.00_y253.87)tep photoinitiators136 and, more generally, nonlinear photoinitiators could be used to compensate for the exponential decay of light absorption, enabling the upscaling of these technologies. Another important development would involve the red-shifting of the excitation wavelengths of the initiators to reduce absorption and scattering while retaining high reactivity, as well as opening the possibility for alternative photochemistries. This is particu - larly true for dual-colour photopolymerization printing chemistries, whereas for tomographic printing this redshift has been partly realized by using initiator combinations with absorption in the visible regime33–35, although efficient red and infrared initiators are still sought after.

One interesting perspective in the development of new materials for light-based volumetric printing lies in the use of alternative photo - chemistries that are orthogonal to radicals. In this way, conventional radical-based reactions could be combined with other light-triggered polymerization reactions to seamlessly introduce different materials 

and components within the same printing process, without the need for sequential printing steps or multitechnology approaches137. For instance, a recent study demonstrated such a concept through the 

use of a resin composed of acrylates and epoxides with photoinitia - tors reactive to different wavelengths, polymerizing, respectively, via 

free radical and cationic polymerization33. Th[e ](#_page13_x305.00_y525.87)two reactions can be triggered independently of each other, simply by modulating the 

light source of the printer. Another interesting avenue is the use of photocleavable protecting groups, which after light-triggered removal spontaneously degrades or polymerizes the material of interest138–140. 

A more reversible approach to orthogonality is the use of molecular photoswitches capable of interconverting between two or more iso - mers upon irradiation by light with a specific wavelength141–143. [These](#_page15_x305.00_y133.87) approaches, the orthogonal polymerization of different materials, 

could be exploited to create spatially controlled complex and dynamic environments in which the properties of the printed materials can be precisely and independently modified.

Furthermore, the sound-active ink library needs to be expanded to broaden the applications of sound-based printing approaches.

Currently, sono-active inks are limited to polydimethylsiloxane, <a name="_page13_x305.00_y109.87"></a>epoxy resins and acrylate-based hydrogels. These materials are not <a name="_page13_x305.00_y125.87"></a>quite biocompatible owing to toxic reactive oxygen species or high <a name="_page13_x305.00_y141.87"></a>curing temperatures. Therefore, alternative sonochemistries or mechano-chemistries should be engineered for new (bio)polymer <a name="_page13_x305.00_y157.87"></a>composites inks. One promising approach is to use biocompatible, sound-active micro/nano-encapsulates, such as lipids or liposomes, to <a name="_page13_x305.00_y181.87"></a>load catalysts or crosslinkers for fast sound-triggered crosslinking144.

<a name="_page13_x305.00_y189.87"></a>**Concluding remarks**

Although volumetric printing and field-based manufacturing are young technologies, they have rapidly expanded in the past 5 years, impacting multiple fields of research. The path forward calls for the convergence of emerging technologies such as machine learning and artificial intel - ligence, advanced imaging and multimodal printing (Fig.2). This[ will](#_page3_x39.00_y635.87) enable the development of smart printers that can automatically per- form any desired print with minimal-to-no corrective intervention from the users, and no limitation on the type of printable materials. The abil - ity of field-based printing techniques to ‘overprint’ over existing struc - tures and inclusions, as demonstrated with structures produced via digital light processing, electrowriting and extrusion printing, makes volumetric printing an ideal tool in multitechnology printing devices. This concept paves the way for a future in which elements that need to be produced with conventional layerwise techniques can be rapidly modified, encapsulated or connected with VAM-produced prints to generate complex composite materials. At the same time, advances in materials designs are pivotal for the widespread adoption of volumet - ric printing. On the one hand, a clear focus will be on developing and implementing chemistries that facilitate multimaterial printing using (photo- and acoustic-) orthogonal reactions, as well as radical-free and long wavelength (that is, red-shifting for light-based printing) respon - sive chemistries. On the other hand, the concept of field-based printing could be readily expanded to other types of fields, provided that mate - rials with the desired reactivity are designed. For example, leveraging magnetic fields, microwave radiation145,146[ or](#_page15_x305.00_y165.87)[ ev](#_page15_x305.00_y189.87)en X-ray fields147 — [wh](#_page15_x305.00_y213.87)ich 

can travel nearly undisturbed across most media — could unlock further upscaling of volumetric printing. Furthermore, as shown already on suborbital parabolic flights in a microgravity environment31,148, the[ ](#_page13_x305.00_y485.87)working principles of these techniques make them ideal candidates for rapidly producing a wide range of objects during space explora - tion missions. Altogether, these advancements are poised to propel volumetric printing from infancy to maturity, paving the way for its widespread adoption across industries, research centres and medical facilities, ultimately enabling the near-instantaneous manufacturing of any digital construction plan.
